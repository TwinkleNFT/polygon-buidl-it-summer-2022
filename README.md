# What is Twinkle?

- GameFi 
- Protocol Owned Liquidity
- Collateral Inclusive NFT ( Burn NFT to redeem collateral )
- Intellectual Property

Twinkle is a Collateral Inclusive NFT ecosystem that aims to become a popular component for intellectual property with Game-Fi features.
Each minted NFT holds an ERC20 collateral contained inside the NFT.
The owner can redeem the collateral at any time but the NFT will be lost forever (burned).
Selling an NFT to a new owner will also transfer the collateral contained inside the NFT.
Non-NFT holders are able to participate through Feed2Earn mechanism plus additional NFT items allowing the NFT to level up and evolve.

# Why 

We believe the market needs a proper solution that guarantees the value of an NFT. Every project attempts to boost the value of NFTs by adding utilities, scarcity, and community. The problem is that the price of the NFT is determined by how valuable it is made to appear. Thus, we intend to provide a suitable solution by introducing "Collateral Inclusive NFT" with our Genesis collection of Twinkle Cat NFTs.

## What is Protocol Owned Liquidity. What is NFT Owned Liquidity.

Protocol owned liquidity is an approach pioneered by Olympus DAO to provide liquidity to tokens on decentralised exchanges.
NFT Owned Liquidity is our new token sale mechanism in which NFT mint sales will be used to create liquidity and contained in the NFT.
The NFT have collateral (LP tokens) like Protocol Owned Liquidity introduced by OlympusDAO.


-------
## How to assure NFT value

Each minted NFT holds an ERC20 collateral contained inside the NFT.
The equivalent price of the collateral now gives the NFT a “floor price” as the NFT market value should not go below the value of the collateral contained in the NFT.
If the collateral contained inside the NFT is 100 USDC, then the fundamental value is also 100 USDC.
